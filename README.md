# MediaPlayerQt
I built this media player using Qt framework and C++ language. If it doesnt run as expected, you will have to download the K-Lite Codec Pack.

When you open the program, you can select a video inside your hard disk, clicking on the button "Selecionar Arquivo".

Then the video starts and you can control the volume on its slider and the time of the video using the slider "Posição". If you want to pause the video just press the "Parar" button. Click on "Iniciar" in case you want to start it.
